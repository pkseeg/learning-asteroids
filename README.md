# Learning Asteroids
For my final project in my Intro to AI class (CS 470 @ BYU), I worked on an agent which plays asteroids in the Open AI gym simulator. This agent is in the asteroids_agent.ipynb file. The training code is contained in the gpu_training.ipynb file, which was run on google colab for ~20 hours.
